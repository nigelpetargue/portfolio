          This project is an implementation of a shopping cart using TypeScript, React, Vite,
          Tailwind CSS, and Mantine. It ensures type safety and code quality with TypeScript and
          utilizes React for building the user interface. Vite optimizes the development and build
          process, while Tailwind CSS provides easy and customizable styling.
