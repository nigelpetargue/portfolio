          This project is an implementation of a shopping cart using TypeScript, React,
          Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Mantine. It ensures type safety and code quality with
          TypeScript and utilizes React for building the user interface. Vite optimizes
          the development and build process, while Tailwind CSS provides easy and
          customizable styling.
